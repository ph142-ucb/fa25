Hello! My name is Aidan Lee, I just graduated last spring with a B.A. in Public Health and a minor in Data Science. I am currently a part of the "4+1" MPH program studying Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I am a research assistant in the Remais Lab where I study the epidemiology and environmental determinants of invasive fungal diseases. In my free time I enjoy making music, cooking, and biking.
