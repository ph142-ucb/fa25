Hello everyone! My name is Benny Sun, and I'm a second year Biostatistics MA student at BPH. I recently received my BA in Economics and Mathematics from NYU, and my current research focuses on landscape genomics and gene-drive methods for mosquito control. Beyond statistics, you can also get Bay Area food recommendations from me!
