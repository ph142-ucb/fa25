My name is Zhongming, and I am a second-year Biostatistics PhD student. My research interests include precision medicine, optimal decision trees, and fair machine learning. In my free time, I'm a Manchester City fan and enjoy watching soccer matches. I also love listening to shoegaze and dream-pop music. Looking forward to meeting you!

Also fluent in: Mandarin
