My name is Julia and I am a second year student in MPH- Maternal, Child, Adolescent Health. This is my fourth semester on the 142 teaching team. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2023 with a B.A. in Public Health and a B.S. in Molecular Environmental Biology. My research includes disparities in respectful maternity health care, and bias in physician decision making. In my free time I love to cook, watch reality TV, and hang out with friends.
